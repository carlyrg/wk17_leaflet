# wk17_leaflet
This project involved creating a map using Leaflet.js that ploted all of the earthquakes in the last 7 days from the United States Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed page. The data is pulled at the time of the request so it is always current. The circle markers represent magnitude of the earthquake in both color and size.
